# **Machine Learning Project Basic Structure**

## **Overview**
This project is a simple machine learning workflow using the famous **Iris dataset**. The objective is to classify iris flowers into one of three species (**Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**) based on their features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training (Logistic Regression)
- Model evaluation
